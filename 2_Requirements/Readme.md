# State of art/ Research

This game is one of the classic platformer games, the game consists of a moving platform at the bottom of the screen that the player controls. The goal for the users is to try and destroy all the bricks on the top by bouncing a small ball of the plateform. Every brick the comes in contact with the ball gets destroyed.

I will be developing this application using Unreal 4 engine. The aim is create the game to run both on computers and mobile platforms. This will be a fun little game that can be played and enjoyed by all age groups.
